# JDBC Course Project

Welcome to the **JDBC Course Project** repository! This project is designed to teach and demonstrate the use of **Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)**, a key API used to connect and interact with databases from Java applications.

## Project Overview

In this repository, you'll find multiple examples and exercises that cover important aspects of JDBC, including:
- Establishing a connection to a database.
- Executing SQL queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) from Java.
- Handling database transactions and managing connections.
- Using **Prepared Statements** for secure SQL execution.
- Properly handling exceptions and managing database resources.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Database Connectivity:
Learn how to connect Java applications to various databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc., using JDBC drivers.

### 2. SQL Query Execution:
Execute queries and retrieve results from the database using `Statement` and `PreparedStatement` objects.

### 3. Transaction Management:
Understand how to manage database transactions in Java, including committing and rolling back transactions as needed.

### 4. Prepared Statements:
Learn the benefits of using `PreparedStatement` over `Statement` for secure and efficient SQL operations.

### 5. Error Handling:
Handle exceptions properly and ensure that database connections are safely closed after use.
